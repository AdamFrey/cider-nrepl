# CIDER nREPL

A collection of [nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) middleware designed to enhance
[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider).

## Usage

### Via Leiningen

Use the convenient plugin for defaults, either in your project's
`project.clj` file or in the `:user` profile in
`~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

```clojure
:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
```

A minimal `profiles.clj` for CIDER would be:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT"]]}}
```

Or (if you know what you're doing) add `cider-nrepl` to your `:dev :dependencies` vector plus specific
middleware to to `:nrepl-middleware` under `:repl-options`.

```clojure
:dependencies [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.7.0-SNAPSHOT"]]
:repl-options {:nrepl-middleware
                 [cider.nrepl.middleware.classpath/wrap-classpath
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.complete/wrap-complete
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.info/wrap-info
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.inspect/wrap-inspect
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.macroexpand/wrap-macroexpand
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.stacktrace/wrap-stacktrace
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.trace/wrap-trace]}
```

Note that you should use a `cider-nrepl` version compatible with your CIDER. Generally, if you're
using CIDER 0.x.y you should be using `cider-nrepl` 0.x.y, if you're using CIDER 0.x.y-SNAPSHOT, you should be
using `cider-nrepl` 0.x.y-SNAPSHOT, etc.

### Via embedding nREPL in your app

If you're embedding nREPL in your application you'll have to start the
server with CIDER's own nREPL handler.

```clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require [clojure.tools.nrepl.server :as nrepl-server]
            [cider.nrepl :refer (cider-nrepl-handler)]))

(defn -main
  []
  (nrepl-server/start-server :port 7888 :handler cider-nrepl-handler))
```
